# üß™ Contamination Detection: Toxics Mobility Vulnerability Index (CD-TMVI) Online Tool

## üìç Project Background

To examine how the Beaumont‚ÄìPort Arthur (BPA) region of Texas experiences air pollution and flooding, we developed the **CD-TMVI** (Contamination Detection: Toxics Mobility Vulnerability Index) dashboard using the **ToxPI** (Toxicological Prioritization Index) framework. This tool visualizes census-tract-level vulnerability by integrating 27 geospatial variables across four key domains:

- Built Environment Vulnerability  
- Social Vulnerability  
- Health Outcomes  
- Contamination Sources  

The CD-TMVI builds upon foundational research including TMI (Teron et al., 2019) and TMVI (Malecha et al., 2020), expanding their methodologies to a spatially detailed and customizable format.

## Online Tool: ToxPi-Style Radial Chart Generator

Lauch Tool: https://zhenhang66.github.io/TMVI_ToxPi/

### Initiavtives

To establish a baseline scenario for the Beaumont‚ÄìPort Arthur (BPA) region, we applied an equal-weighting approach across four variable categories, along with equal weighting within each category. This methodology was reflected in the ArcGIS Dashboard.
However, individual perceptions of vulnerability factors may differ‚Äîprompting the development of the CD-TMVI online tool, a simplified and browser-based version of the original ToxPi GUI desktop software. This generator preserves ToxPi‚Äôs core logic while removing technical and training barriers for faster, more customizable use.

Notably:
- The results generated from the online tool match the BPA baseline scenario originally produced using the ToxPi GUI
- Users can explore and adjust weights dynamically to reflect context-specific priorities
- The tool supports any study region as long as input data is prepared in a .csv format
  
üì¶ For comparison, the original ToxPi GUI (developed by Texas A&M and NC State) is available via GitHub at: https://github.com/orgs/ToxPi/repositories

### Case 1. Customize varaible weight to generate CD-TMVI for the BPA region

#### Step 0. Download Orginal Datasets as a .csv file
File can be downloaded at [Downloads/ExampleInput_BPA.csv ](https://github.com/zhenhang66/TMVI_ToxPi/blob/968f560bde395d7be32e2ee617830e7c81a4218e/Downloads/ExampleInput_BPA.csv)

#### Step 1. Upload your .csv file
Click the "Choose File" button to upload "ExampleInput_BPA.csv"

#### Step 2. Adjust Weights
The unit of weight is percentage. We can enter number between 0 to 100 of each variable, and make sure all variables are summed up to 100 in total.

#### Step 2. Generate All Charts
Click the "Generate All Charts" button, we will see the color legend of each variable, ToxPi score of each census tract, and a radial digram of 27 variables of each census tract.

Click the "Export Scores as CSV" to download the total ToxPi score of each census tract and scores of indiviudal variables within each census tract, file was downloaded as "toxpi_scores_expanded".

If we are intersted in any census tract or mulitple for future mapping, we can (multi)check the box "Select for PNG Export" and click "Export Selected Charts as PNG" to download selected raidal diagrams in one single PNG with color legend.
